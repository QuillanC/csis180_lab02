    <h3>Lab 2 Questions</h3>
      <p>by Quil, Saad</p>
      <ol>
          <li>Most HTML elements have a start tag and an end tag with text content in between. But, the reading presented several elements that only have one tag (the start tag). Which elements only have one tag and why is it not necessary for them to have end tags.<mark> Void or empty elements do not need a close tag. Some of these are img, input, hr, area, link, br, meta, base, col, embed, keygen, param, source, track, wbr </mark></li>
          <li>We used a meta tag in lab to defined the character set. Why would HTML allow you to use a different character set? Hint: Think about the fact that HTML is for the <strong>World</strong> Wide Web.<mark> HTML allows the use of different character sets because not all languages use the same set of characters, and HTML is used world wide.</mark></li>
          <li>A web page title typically appears in two places (in the head using the <code>title</code> tag and in the body using an <code>h1</code> header). What is the difference between these two places and why is it useful to put a meaningful title in both places.<mark>The difference is that the title tag appears on the page tab and the h1 header appears on the top of the page. The title tag is useful if you are multitasking with multiple tabs open. The h1 title gives the title significance.</mark></li>
          <li>It is a common convention to name HTML files with all lowercase letters. Why is this convention helpful/useful?<mark>HTML files should be lowercase because the web servers operating systems are commonly case sensitive. So using all lowercase letters will not confuse the system. </mark></li>
        <li>There are certain symbols that cannot be used in a URL. Thus, they should not be used in the name of an HTML file. List five symbols that cannot be used.<mark> Symbols that cannot be used in a URL include: #, %, ?, &, and " </mark></li>
          <li>Fix the following HTML validation errors
<ul>
<li>&lt;img scr="birthday"&gt;<mark>&lt;img src="birthday" alt="birthday"&gt;</mark></li>
<li>&lt;h1&gt;Hello&lt;\h2&gt;<mark>&lt;h1&gt;Hello&lt;/h1&gt;</mark></li>
<li>&lt;a href="file.html" Home&lt;/a&gt;<mark>&lt;a href="file.html"> Home&lt;/a&gt;</mark></li>
<li>&lt;p&gt;First paragraph&lt;p&gt;Second paragraph&lt;/p&gt;<mark>&lt;p&gt;First paragraph&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second paragraph&lt;/p&gt;</mark></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Compare lab2.html to lab2.pdf.&nbsp; How large is each file?&nbsp; Open each of them in various tools (browser, editor, etc.).&nbsp; How are HTML documents superior to PDF documents?<mark> The PDF file was 86 KB while the HTML file is only 3KB. HTML documents are superior to PDF documents because HTML does not take up as much space. Also HTML is more presentable on a website than a PDF file. HTML files are also interactive in a way that PDF's are not. For a PDF file you also need a doftware in order to read the files. </mark></li>
